# JSketch (Android)

A very simple drawing application for Android devices. Allows users to draw rectangles, lines, circles of varying thicknesses and colours. Also supports moving shapes around, and saving the canvas and sharing it. 

This was my submission University of Waterloo's CS349 (User Interfaces) assignment 3.
